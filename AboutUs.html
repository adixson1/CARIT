            <h2>Student Researchers</h2>
            <h5>Research at Kennesaw State University</h5>
            <p>Kennesaw State Universiy is a student-centered, R2 research institution. Kennesaw focuses on having a research-driven environment for 
                all the students that attend. It is among the top 6 percent of universities that research in
                the nation. The Center for Applied Research in Information Technology is a center that focuses on research
                involving technology. Students that are in the College of Computing and Software Engineeering at KSU will
                have a chance to particapate in research during their time at KSU. The center will give students hands on 
                experience with research and help them determine whether or not that want to be a researcher full-time after 
                their time here at Kennesaw State University. The mission of KSU is to support faculty and students in every 
                possible way so having a way for students to research is on the priority list at KSU.

            <p><strong>Why should I become a student researcher?</strong></p>
            <p>Student research can be given internship credit and even receive stipends for working in a group or with another faculty member at KSU. 
                Overall being a student researcher is a good quality to have on a resume and could also depending on the employeer be counted as work 
                experience. Kennesaw has many opportunities for students to become researchers; whether alone on a solo project or in a collaborative way
                with a professor here at KSU
